# mast-bridge

Welcome to the github page for Mast's official tmux plugin.

## What does this provide/do?

This plugin provides a way to make using Tridentu-T (and the Mast TDE) 
easier for those who want to use Mast.

Prime examples of (soon) included functionality are:

1. System Menu Hotkeys (i.e. Music, Power, Network, etc.)
2. Application Hotkeys (i.e. Mast Gardener (Wallpaper Edition))
3. Mastoden Support (Dashboard coming soon to Tridentu)

More functionality is on the way soon.
Check back for more.

## What distros can use/should use this plugin?

This was mainly created for Tridentu Linux's Mast TDE (Terminal Desktop Environment),
but can be adapted to other distros (as long as tmux is supported).

# How to install?

Just use TPM (Tmux Plugin Manager). The link will be below to the repository, but TPM (when you insert the line to install this plugin) 
makes things much easier to handle regarding TMUX Plugins and allows for the automatic updating of this plugin (as well as many others out there).
